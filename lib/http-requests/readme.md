# GET and POST HTTP requests

## y tho?

I was working in a project and needed to create a new record in Mautic (open-source self-hosting marketing platform), so I tried to send it through the API ... and my Flutter app broke. So I am going to figure it out in my sandbox so not to mess up any other part of my app.
